# My Garden

In **"My Garden"**, you find yourself as a meticulous gardener managing a beautiful garden. The garden features three types of plants: fruit trees, ornamental trees, and flowers. Each type of plant has its own unique behavior, and you need to care for each one differently.

## Main Features:
- **Watering**: Water trees and flowers to keep them healthy.
- **Fruit Harvesting**: Harvest fruits from the fruit trees to earn points.
- **Pruning**: Prune trees and flowers to keep the garden neat and tidy.

## Key Features:
1. **Inheritance**: The game utilizes inheritance to simplify the management of different plants. Each plant type (fruit tree, ornamental tree, flower) inherits basic properties from a general plant class and adds its own unique behaviors.

2. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism is used to perform different actions based on the type of plant. For example, pruning or watering functions behave differently for fruit trees compared to flowers, allowing flexible and precise plant care.

3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Using object-oriented programming, the game manages each plant as an individual object, simplifying the code and providing a clear structure for the system.

4. **Save and Pause**: You can pause the game at any time and exit. The most recent data is automatically saved, allowing you to resume exactly where you left off when you return. This feature ensures a seamless and convenient gaming experience.

Points are awarded for completing the pruning of a plant, adding a challenge and enjoyment to every action you take.

The game offers an interactive and engaging gardening experience while leveraging advanced programming principles to ensure efficient and organized code.
